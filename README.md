## Babysitter's Club

This web application is a social network that connects parents with trusted babysitters. By searching for friends, parents can view those friends' networks and request one of their babysitters to join their network. After a babysitter has accepted a network request, a parent has the ability to book appointments with a babysitter. A babysitter can accept requests to join a new parentâ€™s network and also accept requests for bookings.
